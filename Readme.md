I heavily use [Eye Exercises](http://eye.freetonik.com/) by @freetonik. But it has no option for custom intervals, so I've "cloned" it to add one. 

At first, this site was really just a rip-off :grin:, but I plan to update it and add more options. I'm not a good web developer and I really don't care much about code quality here, though I'll try :angel:

### Features and Roadmap
- [x] Custom intervals between exercises
- [x] Volume slider
- [x] Sound picker
- [ ] Sound opt-out
- [x] Web notifications
- [ ] Web notification opt-out
- [ ] Russian and English interface
- [ ] Saving settings somewhere

### Dev Notes
Icons are made with Inkscape (svg is in the repo) and exported as png files. To convert from png to ico:

```bash
convert favicon.png -define icon:auto-resize=64,48,32,16 favicon.ico
```
